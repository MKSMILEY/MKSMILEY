I am an aspiring video game developer. 
I have a BS in Computer Science with an emphasis in game engineering from California State University, Sacramento. 
I have been working for an IT service desk for over 4 years.
This work included preparing and managing hardware and software for deployment to users, as well as general IT support in the form of tickets and phone calls. 
In my work, I have had many experiences including document writing, Powershell scripting, and computer hardware installation. 
I program video games in my free time using Unreal Engine/C++ and have had projects in school that involve programming video games using Java (in the schools proprietary game engine). 
These school projects have involved writing clients and servers, textures and shaders, making 3D models and animations, implementing physics, lighting, writing behavior trees for artificial intelligence (NPCs), and then implementing all of these factors together into a game world. 
I have also had school projects involving intelligent systems, one of which being a program designed to play a variation of chess intelligently against a human opponent. 
My IT career began as a Student Assistant with covered california, where I worked for two years before transitioning into an Information Technology Associate position at the California Student Aid Commission. 
After working there for almost two years, I have transitioned back over to Covered California in the same position.
